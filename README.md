## Description

Holidaze is a user-friendly web app designed for adventurous adults aged 25 to 60 who seek unique and memorable accommodation experiences close to nature. Whether you're a solo traveler, a couple looking for a romantic getaway, or a group of friends planning an adventure, this app offers a diverse range of accommodation options that cater to your adventurous spirit.

This project was created as part of my graduation examination upon finishing Noroff's two-year full-time front-end course. It reflects what I've learned and accomplished during my studies
